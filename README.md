## Setup/Installation Requirements
* The entire project is contained in one major directory named 'Moringa School Landing Page.' 
* Within the main directory, we have and index file, which is the main file accessible on the webpage.
* A README file, which provides detailed information about the project.
* Another directory, Assets, which holds all the other files and directories including the CSS files, Images.
* Whenever one wants to access the landing page, it is from the index page that by default is first accessed by the browser.
## Known Bugs
This being a simple web based project, the process was completed without any known bugs.
## Technologies Used
The entire project is built using two major technologies; HTML and CSS. HTML has been used in providing the general structure of the page with CSS being used in the styling aspect. As such, the HTML has more content as compared to the CSS. Considering that only HTML and CSS are used, the landing page is not much responsive, and that will be attained upon additional technologies such as Javascript.
